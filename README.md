# hello-world
My repository. Taking autographs. Im on the road im on the road im michael jackson.

Also I enjoy dancing and coffee. I know the tutorial talks about coffee but I genuienly do like coffee. I'm sitting upstairs in the food lounge thing at MIT overlooking this nice pavilion feeling good. This will take me somewhere I know it. I just have to commit to the promises I make myself and I can bring myself wherever I want to go. Only I have control of my day, my actions being done only by myself. Dont make promises, make action. Don't think about the future, just act NOW.
